This information is generated in real-time, on-device, using low-power sensors and a sensor fusion AI. The goal is to unite personal devices to be aware of user intent, and adapt their behaviour accordingly, rather than the other way around. Imagine coming home to an Alexa or a Google Home who knows you’ve had a tough day, and plays your favourite music. Ten minutes later, your takeaway order arrives because your phone automatically notified them when you left the office. While you’re tucking in, you get that notification to book that holiday you and your friends were planning. NumberEight is currently working closely with the music industry towards a context-based music discovery, where subscribers to apps like Spotify and Deezer get energetic tunes for their Wednesday workout, but relaxing melodies to help them unwind after a long day. We’re looking for talented engineers in machine learning, data science, mobile development, and web development to join our stellar core team and help us solve this difficult problem.</blockquote>
