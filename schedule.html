								 <blockquote>Bringing AI to Microsoft Office is the key challenge to help users being more
productive at work. The increasingly large amount of time that people spend
in front of Office products requires more intelligent and automated features
to support our daily work activities. This talk will present how state-of-theart
AI technology can be applied to streamline tasks that users routinely do
while communicating with their peers using Office products.
Matteo Venanzi is an applied scientist working for Microsoft. His scientific interests spans across
search and ranking, recommendations, Bayesian machine learning, human computation and
crowdsourcing. Before joining Microsoft, he was a researcher at the University Of Southampton (UK)
from 2011 to 2016, as PhD student and postdoctoral fellow. He published more than 30 journal and
conference papers on Bayesian fusion for crowd generated content at PlosOne, AIJ, IJCAI, WWW,
AAMAS, HCOMP. He has also organized four workshops on machine learning, crowdsourcing and
multi-agent systems at NIPS, ICML and AAMAS (See <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/mavena/">Matteo’s Microsoft homepage</a> for more details).</blockquote>
